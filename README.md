# first_django_project

<br>

## Description 
###
<p> this is a assignment from a coding bootcamp that is a starter project for Pythons Django Framework  <br /> It was just seeing
if we are able to open up a project and create an app and even successfully make links to the pages where the placeholders are also managed to do the json bonus <br>
challenge I have faced in this project is getting comfortable with the transition from flask to django but either way it was a smooth experience. </p>
<p>Another challenge I was facing is redirecting to the other paths over the first path that was created, I needed to make the redirect path the same as the path in our urls.py file match to make it successful </p>
